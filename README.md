### Hey there, I'm Anton, a Fullstack Developer from Ukraine 👋

💻 Currently immersed in non-stop projects, love working on challenging tasks & full-stack projects.

😎  I've been on both sides of the development circle, so I enjoy building pixel-perfect UI/UX solutions, bringing your Figma designs to life, as much as I enjoy creating powerful REST APIs along with setting up the SQL & NoSQL databases & finally deploying your app to the cloud. If you are looking for a person who can do everything, you landed on the right Github profile 😉

👍 My main tech stack is React, React Native, Next.js, Node.js, and nothing nowadays works without TypeScript. I'm also a Python enthusiast 🐍

My latest projects:

Cassandra — the future of finance, a tool that's going to be used by top CEOs in the world. (WIP)

[SparrowInvest](https://www.joinsparrow.co/) — a secure platform and community for women to build and share long-term wealth using Bitcoin. It was created to ultimately close the gender investment gap.

[Uptick](https://uptick.co/) - a platform that brings together all your crypto investments into one powerful dashboard application, that allows you to analyze & optimize your crypto portfolio.
